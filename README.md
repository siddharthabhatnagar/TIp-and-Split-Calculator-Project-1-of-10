### 📖 Overview
The first milestone of my **Beginner-to-Advanced Challenge**. This project is a sleek utility app that eliminates the math headache when dining out. It calculates tips and splits bills instantly using a reactive, modern UI.

### 🛠️ Technical Focus
* **State Management:** Mastering `remember` and `mutableStateOf` to handle real-time UI updates.
* **Reactive Logic:** Implementing a "Logic-as-you-type" flow where math occurs instantly upon input.
* **Material 3 UI:** Utilizing modern Cards, OutlinedTextFields, and Sliders for a premium feel.



### 🌟 Key Features
* **Live Math:** Total per person updates as you slide the tip percentage.
* **Input Validation:** Robust handling of empty strings and decimal points.
* **Dynamic Split:** Counter logic to divide the bill among any number of friends.

### 📝 Reflections
> "This project taught me that in Compose, you don't 'change' the UI—you change the 'state' and the UI follows. It's a total mindset shift from XML!"
